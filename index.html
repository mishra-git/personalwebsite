            <h2>Who Am I</h2>
            <p><strong>Surya Mishra:</strong> A passionate Database Engineer with over a decade of experience. Currently pursuing skills in the Data Engineering space to broaden my expertise and impact.</p>

            <h2>My Early Life</h2>
            <p>Born in Bhutan, I experienced a life-changing event when my family became refugees due to civil conflict during my childhood. I spent 20 years surviving as a refugee along a riverbank, learning resilience and perseverance in the face of uncertainty.</p>

            <h2>My Passion</h2>
            <p>Despite the lack of formal and balanced education in the refugee camp, I cultivated a strong interest in Information Technology. This field has been my source of hope and survival. Over the years, I have established myself as a Database Engineer, specializing in Oracle, SQL Server, and Sybase technologies.</p>

            <h2>My Hobbies</h2>
            <p>During the dark days in the refugee camp, filled with fear of uncertainty, hunger, and pain, I turned to literature for solace. I developed a love for writing poetry, essays, and reading books. Today, I continue to enjoy writing and cozying up with a good book.</p>

            <h2>My Social Life</h2>
            <p>I am a peopleâ€™s person who thrives on making connections and building relationships. Teamwork energizes me, and I actively engage with others through platforms like Facebook and LinkedIn to expand my network and make new friends.</p>
